# Client Packages

This directory contains the client packages for different platforms. To add client packages:

1. For macOS:
   - Create a zip file named `mac_client.zip` containing the macOS client application
   - Place it in this directory

2. For Windows:
   - Create a zip file named `windows_client.zip` containing the Windows client application
   - Place it in this directory

The server will automatically serve these files when users click the download buttons on the webpage.

Note: Make sure the zip files contain all necessary dependencies and are properly packaged for their respective platforms.
